<p>This is my paragraph about Corgi's: The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle
  herding dog breed which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of two
  breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and
  both descend from the line of northern spitz-type dogs (such as the Siberian
  Husky). From Wikipedia.</p>
